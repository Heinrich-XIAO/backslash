## Introduction

Backslash is designed to be flexible. Want a plugin to control your smart lights? No problem. A plugin to search through your ASCII art collection? Why not! Backslash doesn't judge, and neither do we (much). This guide will walk you through creating a basic plugin and integrating it into the Backslash ecosystem.

Whether you're an experienced developer or someone who's just really good at Googling, this guide will help you build something cool.

## Plugin Basics

### What is a Backslash Plugin?

A Backslash plugin is a simple module that you can add to extend Backslash's functionality. It can be anything from a custom search tool, a launcher for your favorite apps, or a shortcut to run scripts you use daily.

### Why Build Plugins?

1. **Because you can**. You're a Linux user, you already solve your problems with shell scripts. Why not make them pretty with Backslash?
2. **Automation**. If you're doing the same repetitive tasks, turn them into a plugin, and let Backslash handle it.
3. **Sharing is caring**. Once you've built something cool, share it with the rest of the Linux community. (They might even use it!)
